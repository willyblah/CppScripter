## Installation

### Using the Installer

CppScripter is cross-platform, but only **Windows** installers are provided.

Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/willyblah/CppScripter/releases/latest).

### Building From Source

**Prerequisites**

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- Any modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- [**wxWidgets**](https://wxwidgets.org/) (version 3.2.x)

**Instructions**

- Clone this repository or download the source code of the [latest release](https://github.com/willyblah/CppScripter/releases/latest).
- Run CMake, either from the command line or using an IDE. If wxWidgets is in a non-standard location, specify the path by setting `wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR` and `wxWidgets_LIB_DIR` when calling CMake.

## Why Cpp*Scripter*?

C++ is not a scripting language, but CppScripter focuses not on the type of language C++ is but on the creation of "scripts" - small programs that perform simple tasks. A "script" can be code for an algorithm, a coding exercise, or even a fun text-based game.
